#### Introduction to Mobile App Development (Front-End)
In this project, we will be building a Mobile Application using the flutter framework which uses the "Dart" programming language. Flutter is a framework developed by google in order to accomodate easy and quick mobile app front-end prototypes. 

A detailed documentation of the flutter framework can be found in the following link: 
<a href="https://flutter.dev/docs"><b>LINK</b></a>

To generalise how flutter works, flutter are made up of, **Widgets** , or in other words, you can imagine it is a super-human ***div*** from web development and followss the similar type of web development where you are just nesting each divs, however, the google framework itself have already provided a pre-made list of widgets built by them for quick-building and convenience.

In our file directory of the project,

The ***`lib`*** folder is where all of our code will be stored for the app with main.dart being the default ***`root`*** of the app.

##### Root of a Flutter Project App
The root of a flutter project app looks something like this:

This is our **`main.dart`** file.

The Flutter framework follows very stricly a ***object-oriented programming style*** when writing code.

All of the text written in <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span> are pre-defined keywords that cannot be used for variable names or class names.

All of the text written in <span style="color:green"><b>green</b></span> are all starting with the first letter being capitalised which is used for definition of class name/type.

All of the text written in <b>white</b> are variables.
